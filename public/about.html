  <h2>Why did you quit Design to Code?</h2>
  <p>
    I didn't quit Design for coding because i really want both <br>
    As at the year 2020 I wanted to learn how to code during the <br>
    COVID 19 lockdown but i dont even khow where or how to go about <br>
    learning it. During my search, I came accross a free design class <br>
    for sartphone users and that was how the design journey started. <br>

    HTML only website.</strong> <br>
